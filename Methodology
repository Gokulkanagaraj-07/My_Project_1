1. Deploy Wazuh SIEM

 Install Wazuh server and agents on endpoints (Linux/Windows) 
 Configure log collection: syslog, audit logs, file integrity monitoring 
 Set up custom detection rules (e.g., SSH brute force, malware signatures) 
 Enable active response modules (e.g., IP blocking, script execution) 

2. Configure Shuffle SOAR 

 Install Shuffle and connect it to Wazuh via API or webhook 
 Create workflows to: 
 Receive alerts from Wazuh 
 Enrich alerts using VirusTotal or AbuseIPDB 
 Create incidents in TheHive (optional) 
 Notify security teams via Discord, Slack, or email 
 Trigger automated responses (e.g., block IP, isolate host) 

3. Alert Enrichment & Correlation 

 Use Shuffle to add context to alerts: 
 Check IP reputation 
 Query file hashes 
 Correlate with past incidents 
 Prioritize alerts based on severity and asset criticality 

4. Automated Response 

 Define response actions in Shuffle: 
 Run scripts to block malicious IPs 
 Disable compromised user accounts 
 Isolate infected machines from the network 
 Log all actions for audit and compliance 

5. Incident Management 

 (Optional) Use TheHive to track incidents: 
 Assign cases to analysts 
 Document investigation steps 
 Link related alerts and evidence

6. Continuous Improvement 

 Review detection rules and response workflows regularly 
 Tune alert thresholds to reduce false positives 
 Integrate machine learning models for anomaly detection
