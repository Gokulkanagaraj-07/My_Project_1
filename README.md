Real-Time Threat Monitoring &amp; Response Using Wazuh &amp; Shuffle

**Introduction**

   With the evolving complexity of cyber threats, organizations need to embrace proactive and 
automated security measures to protect their digital assets. This project offers a strong combination of 
Wazuh, an open-source SIEM solution, and Shuffle, a versatile SOAR solution, to provide real-time 
threat intelligence and automated incident response. Wazuh continuously gathers and analyzes security 
information from endpoints, networks, and cloud environments, identifying anomalies, unauthorized 
access, and possible breaches. Shuffle adds to this by organizing response processes—automating 
processes like alert filtering and threat isolation. 
 
Shuffle and Wazuh together create a effective security platform that reduces response time and 
reduces manual effort. Security teams can create custom playbooks in Shuffle to respond to certain 
threat scenarios, while Wazuh offers end-to-end visibility into system behavior and threat intelligence. 
 This integration not only increases operational effectiveness but also fortifies the resilience of the 
organization against evolving cyber threats(phishing, DOS etc. 
 
By joining real-time detection with smart automation, this solution enables Security Operations 
Centers (SOCs) to transition from reactive to proactive defense. It's a new way of thinking about 
cybersecurity—one that pays attention to the needs of today's high-speed, threat-laden digital world and sets 
the stage for brighter, quicker, and more responsive security operations.
